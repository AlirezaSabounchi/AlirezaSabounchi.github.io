# Projects

## Research Projects

### Dr. Fattahi’s Lab (Fall 2022 – Present)
**Research Focus:**
- Construction of novel molecular libraries using combinatorial chemistry
- Modeling uncertainty in affinity predictions within molecular docking tools
- Virtual screening of molecular libraries for desired properties

### RIML Lab (Summer 2024)
**Research Focus:**
- Molecular property prediction using pre-training and denoising techniques

**Responsibilities:**
- Executed and debugged code from GitHub repositories
- Enhanced existing code by adding or modifying features
- Preprocessed molecular structures for downstream tasks
- Evaluated model performance across various molecular datasets (MoleculeNet)

## Publications & Articles
